![Screenshot 2025-02-09 at 12.49.41â€¯PM.png](/assets/post/deep-seek-dive-deep/Screenshot_2025-02-09_at_12.49.41_PM.png)

The landscape of model training is undergoing a significant transformation. 

- Traditional approaches focused on scaling models by increasing their size and computational power.
- However, recent advancements have shifted the paradigm towards optimizing inference time compute, trading off upfront costs for more efficient performance.

The development of reasoning models has reached a pivotal point. Initially spearheaded by OpenAI's o1 Mini, the field has seen rapid advancements with new models emerging. 

DeepSeek's latest release, for instance, rivals OpenAI's offerings and is completely open-sourced under an MIT license. Despite the limited details in their publication, the model's performance is noteworthy, highlighting the potential for further enhancements.

## **1.2 Objective and Methodology**

DeepSeek's primary goal is to harness the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) to develop reasoning capabilities without relying on supervised data. This is achieved through a pure Reinforcement Learning (RL) process. By employing RL, they discovered that models could achieve high performance without traditional supervised data, focusing instead on self-evolution and reflection.

## **1.3 Training Approach**

The training methodology for DeepSeek's models is innovative and multi-staged:

1. **Post-Training with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)**: The base model, DeepSeek-V3, undergoes post-training with GRPO, leading to emergent reasoning capabilities and enhanced performance.
2. **Four-Stage Training for R1**:
    - **Cold Start**: Initial phase to stabilize the model.
    - **RL for Reasoning**: Focused training to enhance reasoning skills.
    - **Rejection Sampling**: Applied for general-purpose refinement.
    - **RL Polishing**: Final stage to fine-tune the model's capabilities.

## **1.4 Model Variants**

DeepSeek introduces two primary models:

- **R1-Zero**: A specialized reasoning model trained on Chain of Thought (CoT) using RL, excelling in reasoning but lacking general model capabilities.
- **R1**: Developed from R1-Zero outputs and the four-stage training process, R1 is a robust reasoning and chat model.

## **1.5 Distillation and Performance**

Outputs from R1 are distilled into Qwen and Llama models, demonstrating exceptional performance even without native RL training. Distillation proves more effective than traditional RL post-training, offering a computationally efficient alternative.

## **1.6 Open Source and Accessibility**

DeepSeek's models are fully open-sourced under the MIT license, though training data and code remain undisclosed. The models are hosted on DeepSeek's API, which boasts speeds 3 to 10 times faster and more cost-effective than other providers, albeit with considerations for data privacy.
